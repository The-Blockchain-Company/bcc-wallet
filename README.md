## Overview

Bcc Wallet helps you manage your Bcc. You can use it to send and
receive payments on the [Bcc](https://www.bcc.org) blockchain.

This project provides an HTTP Application Programming Interface (API)
and command-line interface (CLI) for working with your wallet.

It can be used as a component of a frontend such as
[Klarity](https://klaritywallet.io), which provides a friendly user
interface for wallets. Most users who would like to use Bcc should
start with Klarity.

> :information_source: This source code repository contains the next major version of Bcc
> Wallet, which has been completely rewritten for the
> [Sophie](https://roadmap.bcc.org/) phase.
>
> :bulb: The Cole version of Bcc Wallet is in the
> [bcc-sl](https://github.com/The-Blockchain-Company/bcc-sl)
> repository.

## Getting Started

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-Blockchain-Company/bcc-wallet/master/docker-compose.yml
NETWORK=testnet docker-compose up
```

Fantastic! The server is up-and-running, waiting for HTTP requests on `localhost:8090/v2` e.g.:

```
curl http://localhost:8090/v2/network/information
```

or to be accessed via CLI, e.g.:

```
docker run --network host --rm tbco/bcc-wallet network information
```

See also [Wiki - Docker](https://github.com/The-Blockchain-Company/bcc-wallet/wiki/Docker) for more information about using docker.
